# Code Challenge 1 - Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray that takes in an array and returns a reversed version of the original array without using any built-in java methods.

## Challenge
The functions needs to be able to work on arrays of any length.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach I thought was easiest.

# Code Challenge 2 - Insert and shift middle index of array
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added and return an array with the new value added at the middle index without using any built-in java methods.

## Challenge
The functions needs to work arrays with even and odd numbered lengths.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach I thought used the simplest logic.

# Code Challenge 3 - # Binary Search
The function takes an array of integers and an integer and return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the integer, or -1 if the element does not exist. All without using any built-in java methods.

## Challenge
Figuring out the algorithm we were supposed to use and translating it into java

## Approach & Efficiency
I used the Binary Search Algorithm as per the code challenges requirement
