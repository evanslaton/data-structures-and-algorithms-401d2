# Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is one of the three common “simple sorts”.

## Challenge
Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
* O(n^2) space - uses a nested loop
* O(1) time - sorts the input array in place instead of creating a new array
