# Merge two Linked Lists
Built upon previous code challenges where I created a LinkedList class and methods for manipulating the linked lists.

## Challenge
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges

## Approach & Efficiency
I merged the linked list passed in as the second argument into the linked list passed in as the first. I chose this method beacuse its Big O space is constant.
* Time: O(n)
* Space: (1)
